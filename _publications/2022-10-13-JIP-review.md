Abstract: Hemipteran pests are among the most important threats to agricultural production. Losses associated 
with these insects result from both feeding-associated damage and the transmission of plant pathogens by some 
species. Key among hemipteran pests of agricultural importance are stink bugs, whitefly, aphids and psyllids. 
While bacteria provide an excellent resource for identification of environmentally benign pesticidal proteins 
for use against pest insects, relatively few with activity against hemipteran species have been identified. 
In this comprehensive review including the patent literature, we describe physiological features unique to Hemiptera 
that may restrict the toxicity of bacterial pesticidal proteins, provide an overview of Hemiptera-active pesticidal 
proteins and associated structural classes, and summarize biotechnological strategies used for optimization of toxicity 
against target hemipteran species.
