Abstract: Hyaluronidase inhibitors have immense applications in pathophysiological conditions associated with hyaluronan-hyaluronidase system. The present study demonstrates the inhibitory efficacy of clinically accepted antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) against hyaluronidase of serum, testis, and snake and bee venoms. The experimental and molecular dynamic simulation data suggest the non-competitive inhibition and involvement of thiol groups of both NAC and glutathione in exertion of inhibition. The bioavailability, less-toxic and antioxidant nature of NAC and glutathione could become valuable in the management of pathologies triggered by extracellular matrix degradation and to increase the endurance of hyaluronan based biomaterials/supplements, which are highly exciting aspects.
